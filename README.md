# hello-world
ideas, inspiration, work to be done
I'm Ellie Howard, a creative brand storyteller, studying Public Relations at Azusa Pacific University. My passion is found in art, music, and people. I do everything I can to surround myself with these joys in my personal life and work as I create some myself and learn from other creators.
